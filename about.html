					<p id="gaztext">Guitarist Gary O'Keeffe aka Gaz started DNA in 2004 after having played in numerous bands over the years as a drummer. He taught himself guitar and after some brief stints in a couple more bands decided to take it to the music industry with his own hard hitting tunes. His first written tune Deprived was the initial song the band DNA was founded on.</p>

					<p id="pidgeytext">Drummer of the feathered variety, Michael Mullally aka Pidgey, long time friend of Neo has always been an avid dedicated gamer and he was extremely dedicated when it came to playing Guitar Hero on the Xbox. After Neo watched him play the drums on Expert for Archenemies song Nemesis, he informed Pidgey he was to be the new drummer for DNA. After many arguments and complaining that the skills didn't transpose, he decided to give it a go and blew everyone away. Complete Natural!</p>

					<p id="neotext">The 'other' guitarist, James Maguire aka Neo became involved with DNA in late 2005 when a mutual friend (sparky) of his and Gaz's introduced them. Neo was then only beginning on his road as a guitarist and dreamed of playing on stage. Not much has changed, though he can at least hold the thing and hit a string or two. Neo also works with Gaz on song writing and the first collaborated song between the two was Silk Vicky.</p>

					<p>In an age when every single band uses auto-enhancing equipment both in the studio and live on stage, one Band refuses to attempt to fool their audience. DNA have never and never will use any of that crap.. If you are sick of been lied to as music lover, sick of been sold computer generated perfection and long for the days of vinyl (because couldn't use this crap on analogue) Then you have just found that band for you. DNA the only band we know of that records and plays live by plugging in and playing. Sometimes is not perfect but at least its REAL</p>
